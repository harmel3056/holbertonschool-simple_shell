.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
A simplified UNIX command-line interpreter written in C.
It provides basic functionality to parse and execute commands, similar to
a standard shell environment.
.sp 1
.B The simple shell
reads input from standard input, parses it into tokens (arguments), and
executes commands either from absolute/relative paths or by searching the
directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.
.sp 1
The following features are supported:

.Sy Command execution in PATH

Commands located in the system PATH (e.g. \fBls\fR, \fBpwd\fR, \fBecho\fR)\fR can be executed.

.Sy Absolute or relative paths
.Pp
Commands can be run directly by path (e.g. \fB/bin/ls\fR, \fB./hsh\fR).
.sp 1
.Sy Built-in commands
.Pp
The following built-ins are supported:

.Sy exit - 
Exits the shell with the status of the last executed command.

.Sy env -
Prints the current environment variables.
.sp 1
.Sy Interactive mode -
When run from a terminal, the shell displays a prompt (\fB$\fR).

.Sy Non-interactive mode -
Commands can be piped or redirected into the shell.

.sp 1
.Sh EXIT STATUS

The shell exits with the status code of the last executed command.
If a command is not found, the shell prints an error message of the form:

.Pp
.Sy Ar <progname>: <line_number>: <command>: not found

.sp 1
.Sh ENVIRONMENT

.Sy PATH -
A colon separated list of directories in which to search for commands.

.Sy environ -
The environment is passed to child processes via \fBexecve\fR.


.Sh EXAMPLES
The following are examples of how to use the simple shell
.Pp
To run the "ls" command.
.Pp
Where "($)" is the prompt.
.sp 1
.Pp
.Sy In interactive mode:
.Pp
$ ./hsh // To run the simple shell.
.Pp
($) ls -l
.Pp
($) exit

.sp 1
.Pp
.Sy In non-interactive mode:
.Pp
$ echo "ls /var" | ./hsh
