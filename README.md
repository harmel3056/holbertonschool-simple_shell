# Simple Shell Project
This repository contains the Simple Shell group project completed as part of Holberton School's C27 curriculum.

## Description
A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with an operating system by executing commands.
This simple shell provides a stripped-back version of that environment, for education purposes.
